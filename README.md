Learn Parallex_Effect using CSS
The "parallax effect" is basically how things seem to move differently depending on how close they are to you. Imagine you're on a train looking out the window. Nearby trees zoom past quickly, while mountains in the distance seem to barely move. That's parallax!

Here are two ways to think about it:

1. **Like holding your hand up:** Close one eye and hold your thumb out at arm's length. Now open and close your other eye. See how your thumb jumps back and forth against the background? That's because your eyes are in slightly different positions, giving you two different "lines of sight" to your thumb.
2. **Driving past a fence:** As you drive, the fence posts closest to you whiz by, while the ones further away seem to move slower. This is because the closer posts are changing their position relative to you more quickly.

The parallax effect is used in lots of cool ways, like:

* **Video games:** Creating depth and making things feel more 3D.
* **Websites:** Making scrolling more interesting and interactive.
* **Astronomy:** Measuring the distance to stars.
